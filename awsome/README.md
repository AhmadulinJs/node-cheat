*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a server-side framework, one of it’s main works is to handle browser requests.
*   Node.js is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, It is designed to build scalable network applications.
*   A [cookie](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.html) is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
*   Cookies are small files which are stored on a user's computer.
*   In JavaScript, functions are regarded as first-class objects. That means you can do all the operations with a function that you can do with regular objects. You can assign functions to a variable, pass these as arguments to methods, declare them as a property of an object, and even return them from functions.
*   An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string.
*   JavaScript is a quirky, object-oriented, C-like language.
*   Error-first callbacks means first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object. Additional arguments are used to pass data.
*   Callback functions are derived from a programming paradigm known as functional programming.
*   A callback function is also known as a higher-order function.
*   The event emitter pattern allows you to decouple the producers and consumers of events using a standard interface.
*   REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a window console or unix/linux shell.
*   Node.js comes bundled with a REPL environment: 
    *   Read– Reads user’s input, parse the input into JavaScript data-structure and stores in memory.
    *   Eval– Takes and evaluates the data structure
    *   Print– Prints the result
    *   Loop– Loops the above command until user press ctrl-c twice.
